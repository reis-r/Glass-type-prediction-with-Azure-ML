All data importing and treating is done by the [train.py](https://github.com/reis-r/nd00333-capstone/blob/master/train.py) script. This will be the script used by our Hyperdrive run. The objective will be to classify the glass type according to it's composition and other characteristics. This dataset was chosen because it will not take too much time for cleaning, and it's a very known dataset for experimenting with machine learning."
